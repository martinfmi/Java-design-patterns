# Java-design-patterns
The GoF design patterns implemented in Java using a set of classes for a simple network device management system of Cisco/Juniper devices. 
Each pattern is described in a package in the form of **<root_package>.<pattern_category>.<pattern_name>** package.

*Note that some of the pattern packages reuse classes from other packages for the purpose of simplicity, reducing duplication of classes for the illustration and providing simplicity for the examples demonstrated.*
